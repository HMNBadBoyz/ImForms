		TODO File 
			for 
	Winforms ImGUI wrapper 
=============================


Version : 0.1.0
Contributers: Mohamed Shazan


Completed
=========
Controls:
	- Checkbox
	- LinkLabel
	- TrackBar
	- Prograssbar
	- Radiobutton
	- Button
Temporarily removed:
    - Label

To be Completed
===============
- Remove Timer from Imgui.cs
- Add test case for sorting
- Controls not responsive to updated values:
	- Label
    - CheckBox
    - Button
    - RadioButton
- Redraw needs to be fast! There may be many ways to do this. Pick one, and only one, that works.
	- Suspend repaint while DisplayedControls is being modified
	- Flag controls as invisible instead of removing from DisplayedControls
- Controls need to be freed from memory (ie, dereferenced and Dispose()d once a certain # have been allocated
	- Easy way to do this: Delete 50 non-drawn controls once you hit 100 of them
	- DON'T COMMIT THIS WITHOUT TESTING IT. DON'T COMMIT ANYTHING WITHOUT TESTING IT.
- Rename SkipFrame()... update usercode so it gets called by a timer every 100 ms.
- Make ImGui a non-static class.
- Upload this to somewhere public + get feedback.
- More controls:
   - Combobox
   - More controls from WinForms
   - Controls based on those in ImGui
       - Make from combination of existing controls?
       - Use third party library?
       - Make custom WinForms control?
     
NOTE FROM OZZY: Each step may create bugs! Fix these bugs before going to the next step!
